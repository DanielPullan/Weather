# Weather
Weather is a python based project that creates a webpage which changes depending on the current weather.

# Directions
Set the long/lat location of the area you would like your page to reflect the weather of. You will also need to set a API key from Dark Sky. Run the Python script to create the files and put the resulting files on a web server.

# Warning
Make sure not to publish your API key.

# Status
**No further updates** Would rather work on something else.
